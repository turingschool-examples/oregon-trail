// Read the instructions for each of the warm up exercises carefully. This may
// seem repititious or pedandtic at first, however it's very important that you
// become comfortable with these fundamental concepts. Do not move on to
// iteration 1 until you are confident that you've completed all of iteration 0.


//------------------------- Variables -------------------------//

// Initialize two new variables, "name", and "age", and assign values to them with
// your own name and age.

// var name = "Your name";
// var ...


// Initialize a new variable "someThing", but leave it undefined



// Initialize a new variable "isHuman", and assign it to a boolean value of your
// choice



// Reassign (not initialize) your "age" variable from above. Use a built in math
// operator to make your age half of what it currently is.



// Create a variable named "greeting", and assign it to a greeting of your
// choice. Your chosen greeting must make use of your "name" variable from above



// Create a new variable named "isMinor", and use a comparison operator to
// assign a boolean value to this variable. If "age" is less than 18, the
// variable should be true, otherwise it should be false. You MUST use a
// comparison operator.




//------------------------- Conditionals -------------------------//


// Express the following in code: If the variable age is greater than 100 log
// the statement 'Oh! So old!', otherwise, log the statement 'Still a spring
// chicken!'



// Express the following in code: If the length of the variable name is longer
// the 5 characters, log the statement 'Hi there [name]!'. Otherwise, log the
// statement 'Well hello [name]'. In either case, the value stored in the name
// variable should be included in the logged statement.




//------------------------- Arrays -------------------------//

// Create a new variable "numbers" and assign it to an Array of 10 different
// numbers



// Write the code to access the 5th element of the Array, using bracket
// notation.


// Create a new variable "planets" and assign it to an Array the 8 planets in
// our solar system, represented by their names as Strings.


// Write the code to access the 7th planet from the sun, using bracket notation.


//------------------------- Objects -------------------------//

// Create a new variable "planet" and assign to it an object literal with two
// keys: name, and hasWater. The value for name should the string 'Earth', and
// the value for hasWater should be true


// Write the code to add the key of habitable, with the value of true. Use dot
// notation to do this. DO NOT modify your code from above.
